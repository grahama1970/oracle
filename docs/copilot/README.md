# Copilot Browser Integration (Oracle Fork)

This folder is self-contained for Copilot Web additions. Legacy docs remain untouched; see pointers below.

Contents (maintained):
- `browser-mode.md` — current behavior: model chip, timeouts, single-turn default.
- `auth.md` — concise auth + troubleshooting for Copilot.
- `smoke.md` — smoke test checklist (single turn by default; human opt-in for follow-ups), artifact locations.

Legacy references (not edited here):
- See `docs/copilot/LEGACY.md` for the list of historical Copilot docs (auth guides, fix summaries, etc.). They’re kept for history; use the files above as the source of truth.
